# CNNmulticlassification
Goal: To design, train and test a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a multi-class
classification problem.
Dataset: We are going to use the MNIST handwritten digit database with additive correlated noise.
The images and class labels are contained in the file 'MNIST_CorrNoise.npz'.
Kera library is used.
